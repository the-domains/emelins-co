Hi, my name is Christina (Hi Christina) and I am passionate about drawing.  There is something necessary and beautiful about a pen and paper.  No one ever talks about it, but when something is handwritten or drawn it carries significance---and I want to share that with others. I love to make ideas come to life and see a clients vision coming to fruition.  I am in a constant state of learning through the inspiration our world yields.  Also, if I was Batman, pens would be my Robin.

I love spending time with my dashingly, handsome husband and three kids. We live in a bright, red house with lime green trim in Sonoma County, CA. I pretend to be an avid runner when really I'm only mildly committed. I love good food---minus bananas.
